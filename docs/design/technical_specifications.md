## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the technical specifications for the project. It covers the architecture, technology stack, design decisions, and system requirements necessary for the development and deployment of the system.

---

## Architecture

The system is composed of the following key components:

1. **Frontend**: 
   - **Technology**: React.js
   - **Description**: The frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. It communicates with the backend API to retrieve and display data.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Component-based architecture
     - State management using Redux
     - Responsive design with Bootstrap

2. **Backend API**: 
   - **Technology**: Node.js, Express.js
   - **Description**: The backend API handles all business logic, processes client requests, and interacts with the database. It serves as the intermediary between the frontend and the database.
   - **Key Features**:
     - RESTful API design
     - JWT-based authentication
     - Input validation and error handling

3. **Database**:
   - **Technology**: PostgreSQL
   - **Description**: The database stores all persistent data, including user information, system logs, and application data. It is designed to handle complex queries and ensure data integrity.
   - **Key Features**:
     - ACID compliance
     - Relational data model
     - Support for JSON data types

## Design Decisions

### 1. **Technology Stack**
   - **Frontend (React.js)**: Chosen for its declarative, component-based approach, which simplifies the development of complex user interfaces. React's virtual DOM ensures efficient rendering, making it ideal for dynamic applications.
   - **Backend (Node.js with Express.js)**: Selected for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is well-suited for handling concurrent requests in a scalable manner. Express.js provides a minimalistic yet powerful framework for building RESTful APIs.
   - **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Preferred for its robustness, advanced querying capabilities, and support for complex data relationships. PostgreSQL's support for JSON data types also allows for flexibility in handling semi-structured data.

### 2. **Security Considerations**
   - **Authentication**: Implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely authenticate users. Tokens are issued on login and must be included in the header of subsequent requests to protected endpoints.
   - **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data, such as passwords and personal information, is encrypted before being stored in the database. The application uses industry-standard encryption algorithms to protect user data.
   - **Input Validation**: All input data is validated both on the client and server sides to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached using Redis, reducing the load on the database and improving response times.
   - **Asynchronous Processing**: Time-consuming tasks, such as sending emails or processing large datasets, are handled asynchronously using a job queue (e.g., Bull or RabbitMQ), ensuring that the API remains responsive to user requests.

### 4. **Scalability**
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: The application is designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances of the backend API and database replicas. Load balancing is employed to distribute traffic evenly across instances.
   - **Microservices Architecture**: Although the current implementation is monolithic, the architecture is designed with a future transition to microservices in mind. This would allow for independent scaling and deployment of different application components.

## System Requirements

### 1. **Minimum Requirements**
   - **RAM**: 4 GB
   - **Storage**: 10 GB
   - **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+), macOS, or Windows 10

### 2. **Recommended Requirements**
   - **RAM**: 8 GB
   - **Storage**: 20 GB SSD
   - **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), macOS (10.15+)

### 3. **Software Dependencies**
   - **Node.js**: v14.x or higher
   - **PostgreSQL**: v12.x or higher
   - **Redis**: v6.x or higher (for caching, optional)
   - **Docker**: Required for containerized deployment (optional)

---

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. **Environment Configuration**
   - **Environment Variables**: The application relies on environment variables for configuration. Key variables include `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `REDIS_URL`. These should be set in a `.env` file for local development or configured in the deployment environment.

### 2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipelines are set up using GitHub Actions. The pipeline runs tests, builds the application, and deploys it to a staging environment on every push to the `main` branch. Deployment to production is triggered manually after successful staging tests.

### 3. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - **Monitoring**: The application is monitored using Prometheus, with Grafana dashboards providing real-time insights into system performance and health metrics.
   - **Logging**: Logs are centralized using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), allowing for efficient searching and analysis of log data.
