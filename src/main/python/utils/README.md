## Overview

This directory is dedicated to utility functions that are commonly used throughout the Python application. These functions are designed to encapsulate reusable logic that can be easily invoked across various modules, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

Utility functions play a crucial role in software development by abstracting common tasks that might otherwise require repetitive code. By centralizing these tasks in the `utils` directory, you can ensure that your codebase remains clean, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and easy to maintain.

## Files

### 1. **helpers.py**

- **Purpose**: 
  - This module contains helper functions designed to be reused across different parts of the application. Each function is implemented to perform a specific task, making it easy to call these functions whenever the need arises in your application.
  
- **Key Functionality**:
  - `print_message(message: str) -> None`: 
    - Prints the given message to the console. This is a simple utility function that can be used for debugging, logging, or providing feedback to the user.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    from utils.helpers import print_message
    
    print_message("This is a utility function")
    ```

## Usage

### Importing Functions

To use the utility functions provided in the `helpers.py` module, you simply need to import them into your Python scripts. This can be done at the top of your script file, ensuring that the functions are available for use throughout your code.

**Example**:
```python
from utils.helpers import print_message

print_message("Hello, World!")
```

### Example Use Cases

Here are a few scenarios where utility functions might come in handy:

- **Logging Messages**: 
  - Use `print_message()` to log important information, errors, or status updates to the console during the execution of your program.
- **Data Validation**: 
  - You might create a function like `validate_input()` in `helpers.py` to standardize the validation of user input across different modules.
- **API Requests**: 
  - If your application frequently interacts with external APIs, you could add a `make_api_request()` function to `helpers.py` to centralize the logic for making HTTP requests and handling responses.

### Extending the Utils

The `utils` directory is intended to grow as your application evolves. You can continue to add more modules and functions to this directory as you identify reusable code patterns. Here are some suggestions for additional utilities:

- **String Manipulation**: Functions for common string operations like formatting, concatenation, or parsing.
- **File I/O**: Utilities for reading from and writing to files, handling file paths, or managing file permissions.
- **Data Conversion**: Functions to convert data types, serialize/deserialize objects, or handle data transformations.

## Best Practices

When adding new functions to `helpers.py` or creating additional utility modules, consider the following best practices:

- **Keep Functions Simple**: Each utility function should perform a single, well-defined task. This makes it easier to understand, test, and reuse the function across different parts of your application.
- **Document Your Code**: Always include docstrings and comments in your functions to explain what they do, what parameters they take, and what they return. This makes your utilities easier to use and maintain.
- **Test Your Functions**: Ensure that each utility function is thoroughly tested. Consider adding unit tests in the `tests/` directory to validate the behavior of your functions.
- **Avoid Side Effects**: Utility functions should avoid modifying global state or performing unexpected actions. They should be predictable and produce consistent results given the same input.
