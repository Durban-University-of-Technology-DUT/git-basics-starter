## Overview

This directory contains the main Java application code for the project. It serves as the entry point for the Java-based components of the application and includes essential utility functions that are designed to be reused across different modules.

The structure of this directory follows best practices for Java projects, ensuring that the code is organized, maintainable, and easy to understand. This README provides an overview of the files and how to use them.

## Directory Structure

```plaintext
src/main/java/
├── Main.java
└── utils/
    └── JavaHelper.java
```

### Key Files:

- **`Main.java`**: 
  - **Purpose**: This is the main entry point for the Java application. It contains the `main()` method, which is executed when the program starts.
  - **Usage**: Modify this file to include the primary logic for your application. It may invoke methods from other classes, including utility functions from the `utils` package.
  - **Example**:
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
            // TODO: Implement the main logic of your Java application here
        }
    }
    ```

- **`utils/JavaHelper.java`**:
  - **Purpose**: A utility class containing methods that can be reused across different parts of the application. This is where you place commonly used functions to avoid code duplication.
  - **Usage**: Import and use the methods from `JavaHelper.java` in other parts of your Java application to perform repetitive tasks.
  - **Example**:
    ```java
    public class JavaHelper {

        public static void printMessage(String message) {
            System.out.println(message);
        }

        // TODO: Add more utility functions as needed

    }
    ```

## How to Use

### Running the Java Application

To run the Java application, you can compile and execute `Main.java` from the command line or within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

**Command Line Example**:
```bash
# Navigate to the src/main/java directory
cd src/main/java

# Compile the Java files
javac Main.java utils/JavaHelper.java

# Run the application
java Main
```

### Importing Utility Functions

To use the utility functions provided in `JavaHelper.java`, simply import the class into any Java file within the project:

**Example**:
```java
import utils.JavaHelper;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JavaHelper.printMessage("This is a utility function");
    }
}
```

This allows you to call `printMessage()` and any other utility methods you add to `JavaHelper.java`.

## Best Practices

- **Organize Code by Functionality**: Keep related classes and functions together. The `utils` package is designed for utility methods that are frequently used across different classes.
- **Keep Methods Simple**: Each method in `JavaHelper.java` should perform a single task, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Document Your Code**: Include comments and Javadoc to explain the purpose of classes and methods, especially in utility files where the code may be reused in many places.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Make sure to write unit tests for your utility functions and any other critical logic in the `Main.java` file.

---

## Extending the Directory

As your application grows, you may want to add more classes to handle different functionalities. Here are some suggestions:

- **Additional Utility Classes**: Create more classes under the `utils` package for different categories of utilities, such as `FileUtils`, `StringUtils`, etc.
- **Sub-packages**: Organize complex applications by creating sub-packages within `src/main/java/` to separate concerns (e.g., `services`, `models`, `controllers`).
