## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

### 1. **Node.js**
   - **Version**: v14.x or higher
   - **Installation**: Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). Ensure that npm (Node Package Manager) is also installed.

### 2. **PostgreSQL**
   - **Version**: v12.x or higher
   - **Installation**: Download and install PostgreSQL from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). During installation, make a note of your database username and password.

### 3. **Git**
   - **Version**: Latest version recommended
   - **Installation**: Download and install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/).

### 4. **Optional: Docker**
   - **Version**: Latest version recommended

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. **Install Project Dependencies**
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using `npm`:

``` bash
npm install
```
This command will download and install all the necessary packages listed in the package.json file.

### 3. **Set Up the Database**

##### 3.1 Create a PostgreSQL Database
Log in to your PostgreSQL instance and create a new database for the project:

``` sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
```

#### 3.2 Configure Database Connection
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual PostgreSQL credentials:

``` plaintext
DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_username:your_password@localhost:5432/your_database_name
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```
This `.env` file will be used by the application to connect to the database and manage other sensitive information.

#### 4. **Run Database Migrations**
Apply the database migrations to set up the initial schema:

``` bash
npm run migrate
```
This command will create the necessary tables and other database structures required by the application.

#### 5. Start the Development Server
Now that the dependencies are installed and the database is set up, you can start the development server:

``` bash
npm run dev
```
After running this command, the application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

#### 6. Running Tests
To ensure everything is set up correctly, run the test suite:

``` bash
npm test
```
If all tests pass, your installation is successful, and you can start developing your application.

### Optional: Docker Setup
If you prefer to use Docker for containerized deployment, follow these additional steps:

#### 1. Build the Docker Image
Build the Docker image for your project:

``` bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
```

#### 2. Run the Docker Container
Run the container, ensuring that the database is linked and the necessary environment variables are set:

``` bash
docker run --name your-container-name -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_username:your_password@your_db_host:5432/your_database_name -p 3000:3000 your-image-name
The application will now be running in a Docker container and accessible at http://localhost:3000.
```

### Post-Installation Configuration

#### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure that all necessary environment variables are set, particularly `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET`, for secure and proper operation of the application.

#### 2. Seeding the Database
`(Optional)` Seed the database with initial data using the following command:

``` bash
npm run seed
```
This command populates the database with sample data that can be used for development and testing.

#### 3. Setting Up User Roles
After installation, you may need to set up user roles and permissions. Refer to the `usage_guide.md` for instructions on how to manage users within the application.

### Troubleshooting

#### 1. Common Installation Issues
  - **`Node.js` or `npm` Version Mismatch:** Ensure that you are using the correct versions of `Node.js` and `npm` as specified in the prerequisites. Use `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to switch between `Node.js` versions if needed.
  - **Database Connection Errors:** Double-check your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to ensure it is correctly configured. Make sure PostgreSQL is running and accessible.
  - **Port Conflicts:** If the default port (3000) is in use, either stop the conflicting service or modify the port number in the `package.json` or `.env` file.

#### 2. Dependency Issues
  - If you encounter issues with installing dependencies, try clearing the npm cache and reinstalling:

``` bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

#### 3. Docker Issues
- **Docker Daemon Not Running:*8 Ensure that the Docker daemon is running on your machine before attempting to build or run containers.
- **Container Port Conflicts:** If you encounter port conflicts when running the container, modify the host port mapping in the Docker run command (-p host_port:container_port).
