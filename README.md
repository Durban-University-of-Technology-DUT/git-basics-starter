## Overview

This repository contains the starter code for the "Git and GitHub Basics" assignment. The provided project structure includes placeholder files and directories designed to help you focus on mastering Git and GitHub commands rather than setting up a new project from scratch. This repository is a part of the GitHub Classroom, making it easy for instructors to manage and evaluate assignments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git**: A version control system to track changes in your code.
- **GitHub Account**: Necessary for pushing your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub.
- **Text Editor/IDE**: For editing files (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).

### Cloning the Repository

1. **Fork the Repository** (if necessary): 
   - If instructed by your teacher, first fork the repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy under your account, which you can work on independently.
  
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/git-basics-starter.git
   cd git-basics-starter
   ```
