from utils.file_utils import read_file, write_file

# Example usage
content = read_file('example.txt')
write_file('output.txt', content)
```

### Functions Overview

- **`read_file(filepath: str) -> str`**: Reads the contents of a file and returns it as a string.
- **`write_file(filepath: str, data: str) -> None`**: Writes the given data to a file specified by `filepath`.
- **`file_exists(filepath: str) -> bool`**: Checks if a file exists at the specified `filepath`.

#### `data_utils.py`

- **`parse_csv(data: str) -> list`**: Parses a CSV-formatted string and returns a list of dictionaries representing the rows.
